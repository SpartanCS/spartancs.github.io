CSE 498 (Capstone) has plans to expand into the Bob Lab (EB 3340) and the System Administrator office (EB 3322).

With CSE 232 in EB 3345 (Dog) and CSE 231 in EB 3320 (River) this will leave only EB 3203 (Bone) and EB 3353 (Simpson) as available labs.

EB 3353 is typically resrved for lab hours for classes like CSE 220 and for consulting hours for CSE 410 and CSE 320. CSE 335 and CSE 331 hold consulting hours in EB 3203 (Bone), along with several 400-level courses.

CSE 450 and CSE 476 both currently have consulting hours in EB 3340 (Bob).

CSE 232 and CSE 231 both have moved their helproom hours to the Hive in Wilson for want of space.

This leaves very little space for students to work on homework with peers in a lab easily or even just to socialize (adding to our issues in forming a student community).

If you would like to voice your concerns on this you can fill out the Google form linked below or you can email the Curriculum Committe representative, Jake Fenton, at [browne93@msu.edu](mailto:browne93@msu.edu) and he can represent your views in the CSE Curriculum Comittee, as well as forward them onto the rest of the student representatives.

The contact info for all current student representatives can be found [under the About page](http://clubs.cse.msu.edu/about/#student-representatives)
