To kick off this school year we will be hosting a mixer for those interested in Computer Science from 6pm to 8pm in the Wilson Auditorium (C102) and The Hive on August 31st. The first 150 attendees will get Insomnia Cookies. There will be opportunities to hear from and meet the boards of ACM, SpartanHackers, and Women in Computing as well as hackathon demos and board games. If you're a new student in CSE, a returning student or if you just want to get more involved then this is a perfect opportunity to get to know people in your classes and interests.

If you're busy then you can also catch ACM and SpartanHackers at Sparticipation on August 29th at 5pm or you can find ACM and WIC at Engineering Colloquium on August 29th at 9am.

This year we're piloting *CSE Night* where all the clubs hold their events on Tuesday, starting at 6pm with WIC, followed by ACM at 7pm and
