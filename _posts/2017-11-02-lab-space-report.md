Thank you to all who participated in the survey about the recent changes to the lab space. Your 102 responses and 48 comments were invaluable in developing a report to the department.

That report is available [here](/assets/cse_lab_survey_report.pdf), in full. Feel free to share it.

Next steps following this include assembling a group to speak with the department chair about the student body's opinions on this and ways we can move forward. If you would like to be involved you can contact your student representatives, whose information is in the About page.

Updates on the meeting with the chair will be sent out via email.
