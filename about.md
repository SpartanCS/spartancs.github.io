## Student Representatives

The student representatives are your connection to the faculty and administration of the
Computer Science department. You should contact them if you have concerns, questions or ideas
regarding curriculum or faculty interactions.

The current roster for the student representatives follows:

## Important Events

### ACM Elections

ACM elects their board members at the end of _fall semester_, before winter break. This is done
so there is some overlap between former board members and incoming board members to ease the
transition and help address any unexpected problems that may arise. This also means it's very
easy to quickly get involved with ACM's board.

### SpartaHack

SpartaHack is MSU's yearly student-organized hackathon. It takes place in the Spring Semester,
typically in early February. Dozens of companies sponsor and attend the hackathon, including Dell, Microsoft, Namecheap, Amazon and Microsoft. Attendance has been free in the past several years and SpartaHack often offers assistance with travel for those attending from other universities.

### Student Representative Nominations

You can nominate fellow students or yourself for a student representative position in late March or early April. Elections take place in late April, which are open to all CSE majors. You can see the available positions from the roster above. You are encouraged to run for and vote for representatives as they are your liaisons to the administration for the college, and your best avenue for communication regarding issues you may have.
